### Course Description: Through this course we can analyse very big data using Map-Reduce approach.Through Map-Reduce we can take out the columns we want to analyse from the whole data using mapper and can perform some aggregate functions on those columns using reducer.

## Introduction: 
We are working on the data which gives information about the list of accidents handled by Barcelona police, incorporates the number of injuries by severity, the number of vehicles and the point of impact.

## DataSource: 
Our data has 11 columns and 10339 rows. The volume of data is 1.69MB. It is structured data set available in CSV format. The data is clean and not messy. The velocity of dataset is fast as it is updated monthly. From the datset we can know the impact of accidents on people in different districts by which proper measures can be taken to eradicate accidents in the future.

## Requirements:
     - Install python3 version
     - Install visual studio code
     - Install power shell
     - Install MS Excel
  
 ## Sequence of steps for execution:
   1. Select a dataset in csv format which has more individual entries for a good analysis from kaggle.com. The dataset should be             structured.
   1. Make sure that your PC has python 3.0(other versions are not supported), if python is not installed then open command prompt as an       administrator and run command: choco install python -y(this requires chocolatey).
   1. Then create a repository in github clone the repository into your local PC and work together on the repository.
   1. Create two python files and name them as mapper and reducer and code them according to your requirement.
   1. In your Project folder, right click and then select open powershell here as administrator.
   1. In powershell run command - python mapper.py
   1. After running mapper run command - python reducer.py
   1. After running these two commands simultaneous output text files for both mapper and reducer will be generated.
   1. Copy the data in the text file generated by reducer into excel sheet.
   1. Select the data in excel sheet and go to the option insert and generate graph according to your requirement this can be either bar       graph, line chart or anything else.

## Big Data Problems
### Nandini Yadav Janga
1. For each district, I will find the sum of victims. 
2. Big Data Solution
   1. Mapper input: One line of data that mapper read:
     - 2017S001190  Nou Barris  Monday  February  13  11  Morning  1	  0	1	3

   2. Mapper output/Reducer input: example of an intermediate key,value pair output by mapper
    * Ciutat Vella	1
    * Ciutat Vella	1
    * Eixample	1
    * Ciutat Vella	0
    * Ciutat Vella	1

  3. Reducer output:  example of a final key, value pair output by reducer.
     - Ciutat Vella	634
  4. Chart I will use to display results
     - I will use clustered column chart to display my results.

### Chaitra Vemula
1. For each Month, I will find the average of victims. 
2. Big Data Solution
   1. Mapper input: One line of data that mapper read:
     - 2017S001190  Nou Barris  Monday  February  13  11  Morning  1	  0	1	3

   2. Mapper output/Reducer input: example of an intermediate key,value pair output by mapper
    * October         2
    * September       2
    * December        5
    * July            1
    * May             1
    * September       1

  3. Reducer output:  example of a final key, value pair output by reducer.
     - April	0.027218934911242602
   4. Chart: I will use to display results
     - I will use Line Chart to display my results.
